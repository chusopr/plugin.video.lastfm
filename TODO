- Configuration option to use YouTube links provided by Last.FM. Right now, these links are ignored because many times they provide videos of crappy quality.

- Try to bypass service.scrobbler.lastfm restriction for video files or write our own scrobbler.

- Support for more Last.fm stations appart from users' ones: other users, playlists, artists, etc.
