## Last.fm stations plugin for Kodi

This is a plugin for Kodi which allows you reproducing your Last.fm stations in Kodi using YouTube content.

Yes, it's very similar to what Last.fm website does, with the difference that, unlike Last.fm website, you can use it easily in Kodi. I created it basically to fulfill my need to use Last.fm in my TV / media station.

Also, quite important, it doesn't trust YouTube videos provided by Last.fm because very often those are very bad quality, instead it performs its own search for alternative sources on YouTube.

The only configuration required is your username (or someone else's!).

You can open it as a music addon, in which case it will reproduce only music, or as a video addon, which will reproduce also the music video from YouTube.

Some more documentation may soon be available somewhere at [chuso.net](https://chuso.net). Or maybe not.
